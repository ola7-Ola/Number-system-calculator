# Number-system-calculator

number system calculator converts value of a Number System from baseX to baseY provided baseX, baseY >=2 and <=36

Also performs mathematical operation such as +, -, /, *

Calculations are based on three(3) operands which are:

Value = number system to be converted i.e ("10011")

v_base = base of the number system above i.e("2")

o_base = Output value base

NOTE: mathematical operator precedence must be followed befor inputing i.e A + B / C should be inputed as B / C + A in accordance with BODMAS

usage:
run as a file provided the machine has a python compiler 

bundled and build as an exe file (pyinstaller)
