# Number-system-calculator

This calculator converts value of Number System from baseX to baseY provided baseX, baseY >=2 and <=36

Calculations are based on three(3) operands which are

Value = number system i.e ("10011")
v_base = base of the number system above i.e("2")
o_base = resulting base conversion
